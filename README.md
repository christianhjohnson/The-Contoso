# The Contoso
During my MSSA course there has been a lot of information about the roles of a Windows server and Azure cloud administrator.  The purpose of this project is to build my skills in perfecting the process behind doing research, troubleshooting, and applying the knowledge in server and cloud administration.  I am noting some of the issues I have been working through, but my code is evolving more and more as my skill in PowerShell continues to grow.  As my skill grows the process to build these resources using PowerShell scripting becomes more efficient.
